# Tracing 

## Decision

Use [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to enable distributed tracing in EDC. [Context propagation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/#context-propagation) needs to be implemented accordingly so that traces are propagated across asynchronous workers.

## Span naming

Open telemetry spans are named according to the best practices mentioned in the [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#span):

```java
@WithSpan(value = "<ACTION>_<OBJECT_RECEIVING_ACTION>")

// e.g.
@WithSpan(value = "save_contract_negotiation")
```
